Team Members:

Preeti Parihar- (id:015218073)

*Setup the environment in Mac using VMware Fusion 12.x Pro(Student Licence) and download the ISO disk image file for Ubuntu Desktop(Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS). Created VM successfully in first attempt by allocating 200GB storage and 6GB RAM and 2 Processors.

*Once successfully reboot I checked version with uname -a and output is 5.10 then using virt manager I setup inner VM using Ubuntu iso file.

*Researched and Discussed about exits and interrupts using SDM as a reference and help each other writing and executing the code.

*Contribution: code for return the exit for each input value provided path: linux/arch/x86/kvm -> cupid.c and linux/arch/x86/kvm/vmx -> vmx.c

Priyanka Devendran- (id:015231411)

*Setup the environment in Mac using VMware Fusion and installed Ubuntu and then created inner vm.

*Discussed and Researched about about exits and interrupts using SDM as a reference.

*Contribution: code for test program that exercises the functionality in our hypervisor modification and help executing vmx.c

Q2.Describe in detail the steps you used to complete the assignment. Consider your reader to be someone skilled in software development but otherwise unfamiliar with the assignment. Good answers to this question will be recipes that someone can follow to reproduce your development steps.
Prerequisites:

To modify the CPUID emulation code in KVM to report back additional information when special CPUID leaf nodes are requested.

For CPUID leaf node %eax=0x4FFFFFFE:
Return the number of exits for the exit number provided (on input) in %ecx
This value should be returned in %eax
Requirement:

Assignment is to modify the CPUID emulation code in KVM to report back additional information when a special CPUID “leaf function” is called.

For CPUID leaf function %eax=0x4FFFFFFE:
Return the exit if defined in SDM and KVM for each input in %eax
If values not found in SDM return 0 in all %eax, %ebx, %ecx registers and return 0xFFFFFFFF in %edx.
If exits not enabled in KVM return 0 in all %eax, %ebx, %ecx,%edx registers.
SETUP the Environment:
We installed VMware fusion 12.x Pro in Macbook then Downloaded the ISO disk image for Ubuntu Desktop(Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS).

Created Virtual Machine by allocating 200GB storage and 4GB RAM.

Clone the Git repository for the latest linux kernel source code :

git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git

Building The Kernel:

To build the kernel (once you have cloned the Linux git repository), the following sequence of commands can be used (eg, for Ubuntu – other distributions have similar steps but may differ in the installation of the build prerequisites):

sudo bash

apt-get install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache bison flex libelf-dev

uname -a (and note down your kernel version, for example “5.4.0-52-generic”)

cp /boot/config-4.15.0-112-generic ./.config (substitute your version obtained from the previous step here though)

make oldconfig (and then just use the default for everything, don’t change anything – you can do this by holding down enter)

make && make modules && make install && make modules-install (will take a long time the first time)

reboot

Note: When I reboot I got following error: Gave up waiting for root device. ALERT: UUID=******* does not exits. Dropping to a shell, BusyBox.

Steps I use to solve above error:

reboot -f (one window will open in front of you with 3 options choose advance option and now you have 5 to 6 ubuntu versionselect the ubuntu version same was before the reboot in my case it was 5.4.0-52-genericpress enteropen the terminalgo to linux source folder and execute below mentioned command in sequence and then reboot again )

sudo bash

nproc(To know the number of processing units, in my case it was 2 core, specify the number of cores in -j option in the below command)

sudo make -j 2 && sudo make modules_install -j 2 && sudo make install -j 2

update-grub(no space between update and grub)

make

reboot

Verify that you are using the newer kernel (5.8, etc) after reboot:

uname -a (In my case version after reboot is 5.10.0-rc1)

Implement Assignment Functionalities:
We edited cpuid.c and vmx.c for implementing code for calculating the number of exit for each input by referring to SDM for each exit.

There are 69 exit reason defined in the SDM, with few skipped. The skipped ones are like 4,5,6 are returned with value 0 in all %eax, %ebx, %ecx registers and as 0xFFFFFFFF in %edx.

If exits not enabled in KVM then we will return 0 in all %eax, %ebx, %ecx,%edx registers.

We modified function kvm_emulate_cpuid in the following file: linux/arch/x86/kvm/cupid.c, and the different exit handler functions in the following file: linux/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c

Build the updated code: After changing the code in KVM for the assignment requirement, you can rebuild using the same “make” sequence commands or simply use below command.

sudo make -j 2 modules M=arch/x86/kvm (*This will show you any error if you have and this way you can check fast, instead of 2 write your nproc output if no error than follow next step to load and unload)

Load and unload the kvm kernel module (kvm.ko) and kvm-intel module (kvm-intel.ko) using the following commands:

sudo rmmod arch/x86/kvm/kvm-intel.ko

sudo rmmod arch/x86/kvm/kvm.ko

sudo insmod arch/x86/kvm/kvm.ko

sudo insmod arch/x86/kvm/kvm-intel.ko

To test changes we need to create a VM using virt manager:
Use the following command to install KVM, supporting packages and virt manager.

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager (*There are different commands available over internet but this is simple and single line command to install kvm and virt-manager)

Verify KVM Installation using the following command. You should see an empty list of virtual machines. This indicates that everything is working correctly.

virsh -c qemu:///system list

Now open virtual machine manager and using Ubuntu ISO file create inner vm:

Open terminal and install cpuid using below command:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install cpuid

Create test program name as Test_Assignment3.c file inside inner vm to test changes of cupid.c and vmx.c

Compile this Test_Assignment3.cfile using gcc and make it executable:

gcc Test_Assignment2.c-o test

Now run this test3 executable file to check the output as following on terminal:

./test

Q3. Comment on the frequency of exits – does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
-->We could see that the number exits do not increase at a stable rate. Attaching the screenshot for the exits for VM with inputs: as 1-external interrupts, 30- I/O instructions, or 32-WRMSR, we can see that the number of exits are higher as compared to others.

-->The exits enatiled by the full VM is: as shown below, this can varry from the host machine configuration.

Q4.Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?
From running the test script the most frequent exit type observed in the inner VM was 30-I/O instruction exit at around 149622 (24876 HEX) exits, and we could see many exit that were 0, such as 2-triple fault, 8-NMI Window, 9-task switch, 44-APIC access, 45-Virtualized EOI, 67-UMWait, 68-TPause, etc.
